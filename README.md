Welcome to my collection of bash scripts.

Scripts that are not ready yet are commented wth #TODO.

Most scripts have comments or console echos for what to do if the script is not working.

I enjoy writing bash scripts, if you have any suggestions feel free to contact me.

Any scripts that are non-functional for real cases are found under the educational folder.

Notes:

  deb-init.sh
  only works for debian buster, should not break anything on other distros either, works for ubuntu bionic except for urxvt transparency.

  SendCivData.sh
   only works for static IP address/folder structure, check script for address.
  #TODO add read for user input
