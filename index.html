<h4 id="introcontent">> &nbsp; Introduction</h4>
<p>
	Opensource enthusiast, part-time hacker and spaghetti code master.<br>
	I'm used to working in a fast-paced multicultural environment in close contact with customers, but prefer working under calm stressless circumstances.<br>
	Great understanding of the basics of computing with enthusiasm to always learn more. Computer and network security are topics of interest but have lately not had time to stay on track with all the new standards and vulnerabilities.<br>
	Excited to get my hands on any broke down computers and will do my best to make it work or rescue required data. <br>
	Always ready to open the back cover of devices for maintenance and reparations, hopefull to learn soldering for even more efficient fixes in the future.<br><br>
	Helpless in analyzing and writing introductions about myself, prefer having a meetup to let you get a first impression instead!
